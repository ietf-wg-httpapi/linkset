        <abstract>
           <t>This specification defines two formats and associated media types for representing sets of links as standalone documents. One format is based on JSON, and the other is aligned with the format for representing links in the HTTP "Link" header field. This specification also introduces a link relation type to support the discovery of sets of links.</t>

            <t>Resources on the Web often use typed Web Links <xref target="RFC8288"/>, either (1)&nbsp;embedded in resource representations -- for example, using the &lt;link&gt; element for HTML documents or (2)&nbsp;conveyed in the HTTP "Link" header field for documents of any media type. In some cases, however, providing links in this manner is impractical or impossible, and delivering a set of links as a standalone document is preferable.</t> 
            <t>Therefore, this specification defines two formats for representing sets of Web Links and their attributes as standalone documents. One serializes links in the same format as the format used in the HTTP "Link" header field, and the other serializes links in JSON. It also defines associated media types to represent sets of links, and the "linkset" relation type to support the discovery of any resource that conveys a set of links as a standalone document.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Sections 1 and subsequent:  There are eight instances of

        <name>Use Cases and Motivation</name>
            <t>The following sections describe use cases in which providing links by means of a standalone document instead of in an HTTP "Link" header field or as links embedded in the resource representation is advantageous or necessary.</t>
            <t>For all scenarios, links could be provided by means of a standalone document that is formatted according to the JSON-based serialization, the serialization aligned with the HTTP "Link" field format, or both. The former serialization is motivated by the widespread use of JSON and related tools, which suggests that handling sets of links expressed as JSON documents should be attractive to developers. The latter serialization is provided for compatibility with the existing serialization used in the HTTP "Link" field and to allow the reuse of tools created to handle it.</t>
            <t>It is important to keep in mind that when providing links by means of a standalone representation, other links can still be provided using other approaches, i.e., it is possible to combine various mechanisms to convey links.</t>
            <section anchor="third-party" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Third-Party Links</name>
                <t>In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to a resource are provided 
                    by a server other than the one that hosts the resource. For example, this allows:</t>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing links in which the resource is involved not just as a link context but 
                        also as a link target, with a different resource being the link context.</li> 
                    <li>Providing links pertaining to the resource that the server hosting that 
                        resource is not aware of.</li>
                    <li>External management of links pertaining to the resource in a special-purpose link
                        management service.</li>
                </ul>
                <t>In such cases, links pertaining to a resource can be provided by another, specific resource. 
                    That specific resource may be managed, by the same custodian or by another custodian, as the resource to which the links pertain. 
                    For clients intent on consuming links provided in that manner, it would be beneficial if the following conditions were met:</t>
                <ul>
                    <li>Links are provided in a document that uses a well-defined media type.</li>
                    <li>The resource to which the provided links pertain is able to link to the resource that provides these links using a well-known 
                    link relation type.</li>
                </ul>
                <t>These requirements are addressed in this specification through the definition of two media types and a link relation type, respectively.</t>

        <name>Challenges Writing to the HTTP "Link" Header Field</name>
                <t>In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP "Link" header field
                    from an application. This can, for example, be the case because not all 
                    required link information is available to the application or because the 
                    application does not have the capability to directly write HTTP fields. 
                    In such cases, providing links by means of a standalone document can be a solution. 
                    Making the resource that provides these links discoverable can be achieved by means of a 
                    typed link.</t>

        <name>Large Number of Links</name>
                <t>When conveying links in an HTTP "Link" header field, it is possible for the size of the HTTP 
                    response fields to become unpredictable. This can be the case when links are determined 
                    dynamically in a manner dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                    a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response fields by specifying an upper bound 
                    for their size. But when the number of links is 
                    unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper bound is challenging.</t>
                <t><xref target="RFC9110" section="15">"HTTP Semantics"</xref> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                    by the user agent ("413 Content Too Large" and "414 URI Too Long"), but no specific
                    error codes are defined to indicate that response field content exceeds the upper bound that can 
                    be handled by the server and thus has been truncated.
                    As a result, applications take countermeasures aimed at controlling 
                    the size of the HTTP "Link" header field -- for example, by limiting the links they provide to those 
                    with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header field to clients. 
                    Providing links by means of a standalone document overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                    (to the web server implementation) nature of the size of HTTP "Link" header fields.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Section 3.3:  Section 15 of RFC 9110 (the published
version of draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics) uses different wording for
error codes 413 and 414 - "413 (Content Too Large)" and "414 (URI
Too Long)", respectively. We have updated the following to match. 

Original:
 Section 15 of HTTP [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics] defines error codes
 related to excess communication by the user agent ("413 Request
 Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), but no specific
 error codes are defined to indicate that response field content
 exceeds the upper bound that can be handled by the server and thus
 has been truncated. 

Current:
 Section 15 of "HTTP Semantics" [RFC9110] defines error codes related
 to excess communication by the user agent ("413 Content Too Large"
 and "414 URI Too Long"), but no specific error codes are defined to
 indicate that response field content exceeds the upper bound that can
 be handled by the server and thus has been truncated.

We accept this change. Thanks.

        <name>Document Formats for Sets of Links</name>
            <t>This section specifies two document formats to convey a set of links. Both are based on the abstract model specified in 
<xref target="RFC8288" section="2">"Web Linking"</xref>,
                which defines a link as consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link target", 
                and optional "target attributes":</t>
            <ul>
                <li>The format defined in <xref target="linkset-native"/> is nearly identical to the field value 
                    of the HTTP "Link" header field as specified in <xref target="RFC8288" section="3"/>.</li>
                <li>The format defined in <xref target="linkset-json"/> is expressed in <xref target="RFC8259">JSON</xref>.</li>
            </ul>
            
           <t>Links provided in the HTTP "Link" header field are intended to be used in the context of an HTTP interaction, and contextual information 
		   that is available during an interaction is used to correctly interpret them. 
		   Links provided in link sets, however, can be reused outside of an HTTP interaction, when no such contextual information is available. 
		   As a result, implementers of link sets should strive to make them self-contained by adhering to the following recommendations.</t>

                <t>For links provided in the HTTP "Link" header field that have no anchor or that use relative references, 
			the URI of the resource that delivers the links provides the contextual information that is needed for their 
			correct interpretation. In order to support use cases where link set documents are reused outside the context 
			of an HTTP interaction, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to make them self-contained by adhering to the following guidelines:</t>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every link provided in the set of links, explicitly provide the link context  
                        using the "anchor" attribute.</li>
                    <li>For the link context ("anchor" attribute) and link target ("href" attribute), use URI references that are not relative references (as defined in <xref target="RFC3986" section="4.1"/>). 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <t>If these recommendations are not followed, the interpretation of links in link set documents will depend on which URI is used as the context.</t>

<t>For a "title" attribute provided on a link in the HTTP "Link" header field, the language in which the title is expressed is provided by 
	the "Content-Language" header field of the HTTP interaction with the resource that delivers the links. 
	This does not apply to "title" attributes provided for links in link set documents because that would constrain 
	all links in a link set to having a single title language and would not support determining title languages when 
	a link set is used outside of an HTTP interaction. In order to support use cases where link set documents are 
	reused outside the context of an HTTP interaction, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to make them self-contained by using the 
	"title*" attribute instead of the "title" attribute because "title*" allows expressing the title language as part of its value by means of a language tag. 
	Note that, in this regard, language tags are matched case insensitively (see <xref target="RFC5646" section="2.1.1"/>).
	If this recommendation is not followed, accurately determining the language of titles provided on links in link set documents will not be possible.</t>

<t>Note also that <xref target="RFC8288" section="3.3"/> deprecates the "rev" construct that was provided by <xref target="RFC5988"/> as a means to express links with a directionality that is the inverse of direct links that use the "rel" construct. In both serializations for link sets defined here, inverse links may be represented as direct links using the "rel" construct and by switching the roles of the resources involved in the link.</t>

                            -- the "link target object" (see <xref target="linkset-json-link-target-object"/>) --

                            of this member expresses the relation type of the link as follows:</t>
                            <ul>

                        <li>Even if there is only one link target object, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be wrapped in an array.</li>

        <name>Link Target Object</name>

                    <t>In the JSON representation, a link target is represented by a JSON object -- the link target object. 
                        A link target object adheres to the following rules:</t>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each link target object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain an "href" member with a value that represents 
                            the link target. This value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a URI reference and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be a relative reference  
                            as defined in <xref target="RFC3986" section="4.1"/>. Cases where the "href" member is present but no value is provided 
                            for it (i.e., the resource providing the set of links is the target of the link 
                            in the link target object) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be handled by providing an "href" member with an empty string as its value ("href": "").</li>
                        <li>In many cases, a link target is further qualified by target attributes. 
                            Various types of attributes exist, and they are conveyed as additional members of the link target object 
                            as detailed in <xref target="json-target-attributes"/>.</li>
                    </ul>

<!-- [rfced] Section 4.2.5:  "allows to" does not parse.  We updated
this sentence as follows.  If this does not preserve your intended
meaning, please provide clarifying text.

Original:
 Limiting the JSON format in
 this way allows to unambiguously round trip between links provided in
 the HTTP "Link" header field, sets of links serialized according to
 the "application/linkset" format, and sets of links serialized
 according to the "application/linkset+json" format.

Currently:
 Limiting the JSON format in
 this way allows unambiguous round trips between links provided in the
 HTTP "Link" header field, sets of links serialized according to the
 "application/linkset" format, and sets of links serialized according
 to the "application/linkset+json" format.

Response:
We accept the change. Thanks. -->

                    <t>Cases may exist in which the use of extensions other than those discussed in <xref target="json-target-attributes-extension"/> may be useful -- 
		for example, when a link set publisher needs to include descriptive or technical metadata for internal consumption. 
	      If such extensions are used, they <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change the semantics of the JSON members defined in this specification.  
	      Agents that consume JSON linkset documents can safely ignore such extensions.</t>

        <t>As a means to convey specific constraints or conventions (as per <xref target="RFC6906"/>) that apply to a link set document,

            Sections&nbsp;<xref target="linkset-native" format="counter"/> and <xref target="linkset-json" format="counter"/>, respectively. 
            For example, the parameter could be used to indicate that a link set uses a specific, limited set of link relation 
            types.</t>
        <t>The value of the "profile" parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a non-empty list of space-separated URIs, 
            each of which identifies specific constraints or conventions that apply to the link set document. When providing multiple

            Profile URIs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be registered in the IANA's "Profile URIs" registry in the manner specified by <xref target="RFC7284"/>.</t>  
        <t>The presence of a "profile" parameter in conjunction with the "application/linkset" and

            <t>A resource <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide more than one link with a "linkset" relation type. 
                Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
                media types, or to different sets of links, potentially provided by different third-party services.</t> 
            <t>The set of links provided by the resource that is the target of a "linkset" link may contain links in which the 
		    resource that is the context of the "linkset" link does not participate.  User agents <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> process each link 
		    in the link set independently, including processing of the link context and link target, and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> ignore links from 
		    the link set in which the context of the "linkset" link does not participate.</t>
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link and obtains links for which anchors and targets are expressed as 
                relative references (as per <xref target="RFC3986" section="4.1"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> determine what the context is for these links; it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ignore links for which it is unable to

        the "profile" attribute <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used in conjunction with the "linkset" link relation type. 
        For example, the attribute could be used to indicate that a link set uses a specific, limited set of link relation 
        types. The value of the "profile" attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a non-empty 
        list of space-separated URIs, each of which identifies specific constraints or conventions that apply 
        to the link set document. Profile URIs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be registered in the IANA's "Profile URIs" registry in the manner specified by <xref target="RFC7284"/>. 
        <xref target="profile-attribute-example"/> shows an example of using the "profile" attribute on a link

<t>A link with a "profile" link relation type as shown in <xref target="Response_pr_link"/> can also be conveyed in the link set document itself. This is illustrated by <xref target="Response_pr_linkset"/>. Following the recommendation that all links in a link set document should have an explicit anchor, such a link has the URI of the link set itself as the anchor and the profile URI as the target. Multiple profile URIs are handled by using multiple "href" members.</t>

                    <name>Security Considerations</name>
            <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3986" section="7"/> apply, as well as those of Web Linking <xref target="RFC8288"/> as long as the latter are not specifically discussing the risks of exposing information in HTTP header fields.</t>
            <t>In general, links may cause information leakage when they expose information (such as URIs) that can be sensitive or private. Links may expose "hidden URIs" that are not supposed to be openly shared and that may not be sufficiently protected. Ideally, none of the URIs exposed in links should be supposed to be "hidden"; instead, if these URIs are supposed to be limited to certain users, then technical measures should be put in place so that accidentally exposing them does not cause any harm.</t>
            <t>For the specific mechanisms defined in this specification, two security considerations should be taken into account:</t>
            <ul>
                    <li>The Web Linking model always has an "implicit context", which is the resource of the HTTP interaction. This original context can be lost or can change when self-contained link representations are moved. Changing the context can change the interpretation of links when they have no explicit anchor or when they use relative URIs. Applications may choose to ignore links that have no explicit anchor or that use relative URIs when these are exchanged in standalone resources.</li>
                    <li>The model introduced in this specification supports "third-party links", where one party can provide links that have another party's resource as an anchor. Depending on the link semantics and the application context, it is important to verify that there is sufficient trust in that third party to allow it to provide these links. Applications may choose to treat third-party links differently than cases where a resource and the links for that resource are provided by the same party.</li>

<!-- [rfced] Normative References, [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116]: According 
to <https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/>, "W3C Recommendation 
16 January 2014 superseded 03 November 2020" (which is odd, because the 
latest published version at <https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/> is dated 
July 2020).

If the information in Section 6.1 of <https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/> 
(JSON-LD 1.1) is still applicable to the citations in this document that 
point to Section 6.8 of the 2014 (JSON-LD 1.0) version, may we update as 
suggested?

Current (Section 4.2, Normative References, and Appendix A):

 This can be achieved by adding
 an appropriate context to the "application/linkset+json"
 serialization using the approach described in Section 6.8 of
 [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116].

...
 A set of links rendered according to the JSON serialization defined
 in Section 4.2 can be interpreted as RDF triples by adding a JSON-LD
 context [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] that maps the JSON keys to
 corresponding Linked Data terms.  And, as per Section 6.8 of
 [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116], when delivering a link set that is
 rendered according to the "application/linkset+json" media type to a
 user agent, a server can convey the availability of such a JSON-LD
 context by using a link with the relation type
 "https://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context" in the HTTP "Link" header
 field.

            <t>A set of links rendered according to the 
               JSON serialization defined in <xref target="linkset-json"/> can be interpreted 
                as RDF triples by adding a <xref target="W3C.REC-json-ld">JSON-LD context</xref> that maps 
                the JSON keys to corresponding Linked Data terms. And, as per
                <xref target="W3C.REC-json-ld" section="6.1" relative="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"/>, 
                when delivering a link set that is rendered according to the "application/linkset+json" media type to a user agent, 
                a server can convey the availability of such a JSON-LD context by using a link with the relation type 
                "<eref target="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context" brackets="none"/>" in the HTTP "Link" header field.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Appendix A:  As <http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context>
redirects to <https://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context>, we changed 
the in-text instances of "http://" to "https://" in the text and in
Figure 19 accordingly.  Please let us know if these updates are
incorrect (i.e., is there a particular reason that this document
uses "http://" instead of "https://"?).

Original:
 And, as per
 [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] section 6.8 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/
 REC-json-ld-20140116/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld), when delivering
 a link set that is rendered according to the "application/
 linkset+json" media type to a user agent, a server can convey the
 availability of such a JSON-LD context by using a link with the
 relation type "http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context" in the HTTP
 "Link" header.
...
 In order to obtain the JSON-LD Context conveyed by the server, the
 user agent issues an HTTP GET against the link target of the link
 with the "http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context" relation type.
... 
 rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"

Currently:

 [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116], when delivering a link set that is
 rendered according to the "application/linkset+json" media type to a

...
 rel="https://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"

Response:
We changed the URIs back to "http://" because this is what the
identifier is according to the specification. It does indeed redirect,
but the actual identifier is "http://". -->
            
             <t><xref target="contextlinkrel"/> shows the response to an HTTP GET against the URI of a link set resource and 
                 illustrates this approach to support the discovery of a JSON-LD context. This example is inspired by the GS1 implementation and 
                 shows a link set that uses relation types from the GS1 vocabulary at <eref target="https://www.gs1.org/voc/" brackets="angle"/>
                 that are expressed as HTTP URIs.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Appendix A:

a) We see that the <http://purl.org> entries redirect to
<https://www.dublincore.org> pages (which we see are fairly long in
length and would have to be broken across lines if used in the
figures).  We try to avoid using "http://" in RFCs if the URLs/URIs
redirect to "https://" pages, unless they are used as specific examples
of non-secure HTTP.

Should this topic be further explained in this section, or does the
citation for [DCMI-TERMS] in the paragraph after Figure 19 clarify
this topic sufficiently?

Response:
The URIs should remain as "http://" because these are the identifiers
according to the DCMI spec.


b) We also see that
<https://id.gs1.org/01/09506000149301> redirects to
<https://www.gs1.org/industries/retail/2D-barcodes>.  Please let us
know if any updates are needed regarding this URL. 

Response:
This should remain as it is because the URI is the official identifier. -->

<!-- [rfced] Please let us know if any changes are needed for the
following:

a) The following terms were used inconsistently in this document.
We chose to use the latter forms.  Please let us know any objections.

 anchor member / "anchor" member
 
Response:
Looks good, thanks.


 header / header field 
   (when discussing fields rather than the entire header)
   
Response:
Looks good, thanks.

 href member / "href" member

Response:
Looks good, thanks.

 Link: https://...   /   Link: <https://...>
   (Per published RFCs.  We could not find any instances of
    "Link:" lines that did not have bracketed URLs.)

Response:
Thanks, we accept those changes.

 Profile URI / profile URI (used generally in running text)
   (per post-6000 published RFCs)

Response:
Looks good, thanks.

 Web linking model / Web Linking model

Response:
Look good, thanks.


b) The following terms appear to be used inconsistently in this
document.  Please let us know which form is preferred.

 HTTP "Link" header field / HTTP Link header field*

 * As RFC 8288 uses the latter form (i.e., HTTP Link header field),
   we suggest removing the quotes.

Response:
We prefer the quoted version and made all changes to make
usage consistent.

 JSON-LD context / JSON-LD Context (running text in Appendix A)
   (We see that usage in
    <https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/> is inconsistent
    as well.  No precedent in published RFCs.)

Response:
We prefer lowercase and made all necessary changes. Thanks.

 Web Links (Section 1) / web links (Section 8) 
    
Response:
We changed all occurrences to uppercase. -->
